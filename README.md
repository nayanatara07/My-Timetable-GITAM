## Introduction

This timetable provides a visual representation of Nayanatara Raj's weekly schedule, specifying the courses and their timings for each day from Monday to Friday.

## Timetable Structure

The timetable is structured as an HTML table with specific styles to enhance readability. Each cell represents a time slot, and courses are color-coded for better distinction. The "Break" column spans across multiple rows to indicate the break time for each day.

## Usage

To use or modify the timetable, simply copy the HTML code and integrate it into your project. Feel free to customize the colors, fonts, or any other aspects based on your preferences.
